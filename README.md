# My-profolio
Hi, I am Cheng Hong Tai, Maverick. I am a year 1 student of the information technology in bussiness, Coventry University. In my year 1, I learnt how to use python to code, use Pydev to code in order to create an image. However, since I don't have any knowledge of IT, coding is a challenging thing to me.

In first few weeks, I installed PyDev from Eclipse and learnt how to create a BMW logo and also the Taichies through the class Canvas. Also, I learnt Tkinter, use it to create a phone interface and also the phone button is also using Tkinter to do.

In the next few weeks, I learnt how to do my programming assignment, the Simple Billing System using GUI.

In the last few weeks, I learnt how to create charts. For example, the bar chart, the heatmap using Pandas and seaborn from Matplotlib. Also, there are also mistakes while you are typing the code. So, I learnt the testing.
Using test case under the code, I can make sure that I didn't type the wrong code.

In conclusion, coding is challeging, need memorising and requires lots of time to test and debug in order to code it right. Despite coding is hard, I think it is actually pretty interesting.
